# Audrino-Projects
The First project presents a Human-Following Robot capable of autonomously tracking and following a person using sensors and intelligent control algorithms. The system integrates real-time distance measurement, motion detection, and motor control to maintain safe and smooth navigation. Designed for assistance, transport, and automation tasks, the robot adapts to human movement while avoiding obstacles. It demonstrates practical applications of robotics, electronics, and embedded programming in creating interactive, human-centered systems.
